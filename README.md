# NCCI Finder Application

This application was made in a Software Development Projects capstone course. My group worked with the NC Department of Insurace to make a web application for looking up Code Inspectors. This helps contractors find inspectors with ease when building homes or commercial buildings. 
It was worked on in Spring 2023, with a final completion in May 2023.
